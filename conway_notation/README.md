## Evaluate Conway chained arrow notation
 Given a (possibly empty) list of positive integers, interpret it as Conway chained 
 arrow notation and evaluate it into a single number. It is OK if your program gives 
 wrong answers for large values due to the limits (bounds and/or precision) of your 
 language's number type, as long as the underlying algorithm is correct.
